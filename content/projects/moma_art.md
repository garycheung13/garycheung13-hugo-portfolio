## About the project

Our team of four worked with a dataset containing the nearly complete record of the Museum of Modern Art's collection of works to visualize geographic changes in how the collection grew during each major modern art movement. We used Python with the pandas library to clean the dataset and D3.js to implement map and bar chart visualizations.

<!-- We did so using the following process.

1. Design the visualization
2. Clean the Data
3. Implementation -->

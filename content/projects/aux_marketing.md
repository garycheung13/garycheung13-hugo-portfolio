## Overview

As a web developer on the University of Michigan's auxiliary marketing team, I was responsible for maintaining several student life and university services used by the university's students, staff, and visitors.

## Michigan Catering
I refactored the codebase for the Michigan Catering's website. The previous site was developed using an unorthodox workaround on the Google's blogger platform. I rewrote the frontend code to remove the dependancy on Blogger and replaced JQuery methods with native DOM API methods. Accessibility improvements were also made by rewriting markup using semantic HTML and assigning ARIA properties.

## Conference and Events
The university's website for booking rooms and buildings for on-campus events. I was responsible for making design and content updates and maintaining the code for our teams custom WordPress plugins.

## Recsports
I handled bugfixes for the event calandar module which ingested Google Calandar data from Recsport's internal system.

## About the project

I developed this explorable explanation project over the course of a month for my data visualization class. It provides an high level explaination of the how to measure the population requirements for group (herd) immunity from infectious dieases. Users are about to observe the spread of an disease in an interactive visualization where they can customize the strength the of a disease and the vaccine against it.
